                            This is a personal fishing report site that I made right after graduating high school, and is the first ever website that I made. 
                            While there are some serious design issues in this site from my lack of web design experience at the time, I added it to show where 
                            everything started. I am in the process or recreating this site now that I have a much better understanding of web development.

                            This is a fully accessible website that I created towards the end of my college. The big thing about this site is that it uses accessible 
                            terminology in the code like aria labels and uses good contrast. This site was to be coded to a WCAG AA standard. Many of the accessible 
                            features from this site are also in this portfolio site you are viewing right now. You will see from the WAVE accessibility check that
                            there are no major issues, and this continues for the other two pages as well.

                        My main task was to clean up their Asset Tracker System(ATS) for their prints and copiers. This
                        consisted of normalizing names, filling
                        out empty fields, and checking serial numbers for hundreds of devices. By the end of my
                        two-month internship almost the entire ATS system
                        had been fixed to meet the company standards, and there was time for me to work on other things
                        like getting printer page counts, normalizing
                        laptop and desktop data in ATS, and creating budget for MTC’s sites.

                        My biggest role at Lagoon was as a Game Supervisor were managing an area of games and employees
                        to make sure the employees knew how their game
                        worked, that the games were clean and stocked, and that the area ran smoothly. This made for a
                        fast pace work environment, so I learned very quickly
                        how to work effectively under pressure.

                            Hello, my name is Matthew Fitzgerald. I am currently in my final semester at Weber State
                            University where I will graduate with a bachelors
                            degree in Full Stack Web Development as well as a certificate of User Experience Design. I
                            have experience working in an IT environment from an
                            internship that I completed over the summer of 2022 at an international company called
                            Management and Training Corporation (MTC) as well as two
                            years of leadership experience from my supervising position at Lagoon Amusement Park.
                        </p>
                        <p class="about-text">
                            I am fueled by a passion to create usable and accessible web pages, and always strive to
                            think in the mindset of the user when creating websites
                            and applications because I believe that having a usable website or application that is
                            accessible to everyone should one of the top priorities of
                            any web developer.

                            My most recent professional success came from the internship at MTC where my main task was
                            to clean up the companies Asset Tracker System (ATS) for
                            all their printers and copiers. This consisted of normalizing names, filling out empty
                            information fields, and making sure that serial numbers were
                            correct for hundreds of devices. By the end of my two month internship almost the entire ATS
                            system had been fixed to meet the standards that the company
                            was looking for, and there was even time for me to move onto working on even more things
                            like getting printer page counts, normalizing laptop and desktop
                            data in ATS, and helping create budgets for MTC’s sites.

                            Along with that I was also selected into the Lagoon E.L.I.T.E. program. E.L.I.T.E. stands
                            for Excellent in Leadership Improving Through Education, and it is
                            a leadership program for the best of the best management personnel at Lagoon. It is a very
                            selective program that only has three to four people selected from
                            each department each season, and it is built to make the best leaders at Lagoon even better
                            for whatever job they might end up in later on in life, Lagoon or
                            not.
